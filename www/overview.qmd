## Purpose of this dashboard

The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is committed to [open data](https://water.ca.gov/ab1755) and the goals of the [Open and Transparent Water Data Act (AB 1755, Dodd)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1755).

The Downstream Dashboard is a collaboration between DWR data collection programs to showcase a workflow for data publication, access, and visualization (Figure 1). This workflow can be adapted and used more broadly to support (1) making data publicly accessible and usable and (2) using open source tools.

This effort is primarily focused on the data access portion of the data lifecycle through the publication of data on the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) and the creation of this dashboard for data visualization and communication.](data_lifecycle.png)

## About the data collection programs

The Downstream Dashboard is currently focused on two DWR data collection program: (1) Environmental Management Program (EMP) Discrete Water Quality Data, and (2) Spring Run Juvenile Production Estimate (SR JPE) Genetics Data.

**EMP Discrete Water Quality Data**

Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it.

Typically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous).

**SR JPE Genetics Data**

The Spring-Run Juvenile Production Estimate (SR JPE) project is a multidisciplinary effort to monitor the seasonal outmigration of threatened juvenile spring-run Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*). As they undertake their journey from their natal rivers to the ocean, juvenile Chinook salmon are captured at 11 monitoring sites located throughout the Sacramento River Basin each year from November to May. Genetic techniques - including CRISPR-based SHERLOCK and genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) - are employed to distinguish threatened spring-run Chinook from co-occurring runs (e.g., Fall, Late Fall, and Winter runs).

## Data management and publication

The Downstream Dashboard data collection programs maintain internal databases as primary data storage and utilize the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://edirepository.org/) to make data publicly accessible. EDI is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded public repository for environmental data with robust metadata standards.

The Downstream Dashboard pulls data from EDI for visualization. The dashboard was designed to facilitate data exploration by allowing users to easily visualize and query parameters of interest. The dashboard is developed in R Shiny and all code is openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SRJPE/data-dock). Publication of the data in EDI is in progress, and the dashboard will be updated with the link as soon as it becomes available. The dashboard will also be updated as future EDI updates occur.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is organized into three primary sections: Water Quality, Genetic and Download Data. The Water Quality tab enables users to visualize temporal patterns, examine analyte-specific trends, and interact with site-based map selections. The Genetics tab allows user to explore run assignment distributions across locations and time. The Download Data tab provides functionality for exporting filtered and customized datasets.
